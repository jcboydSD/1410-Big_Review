 # LEARNING ACTIVITY: BIG REVIEW

In this activity we will be working on some basics and how to code them using C++. These are topics that you would have seen in your previous programming class but likely did them in a different language. There are videos that demonstrate many details about writing functions.
It is recommended that you write the code as you follow along with the video.

We will be writing code in many different files. All these files can be found in the src 
folder.
